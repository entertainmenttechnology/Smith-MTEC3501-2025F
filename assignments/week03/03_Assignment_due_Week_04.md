# MTEC 3501 Assignment 3
**Due for Class 4**

## Clarifying Project Identity + Inspirational Research + GitHub Setup

### Objective
This assignment is designed to help you begin defining your project in a more tangible way. You will:
- Clarify your current concept through a short presentation
- Gather inspirational materials that reflect the tone or theme of your idea
- Finalize setup of your GitHub workspace
- Begin drafting your README
- Identify and commit to a **specific project direction or domain**

> You are **not committing** to a final feature set yet — but by this stage, you should no longer be deciding between unrelated project categories (e.g., game vs. installation vs. productivity app). You should be clearly working within a **defined conceptual zone**.

## What To Bring / Submit

### Mini Presentation
- Format: 2–3 slides (PDF or PowerPoint)
- In-class: ~3-minute informal presentation
- Content:
  - What is your current project idea?
  - Why are you interested in it?
  - What zone/medium is it in (game, installation, etc.)?
  - Where do you think it’s headed?
  - What are some inspirational elements (see below for more detail)
  - What feedback would be most useful to you right now?

### Inspirational Research
- Prepare **inspirational materials**
  - These can be: links, images, video clips, audio, articles, etc.
  - They should reflect **tone**, **subject matter**, **aesthetic**, or **technical inspiration**
  - Prepare to share as part of your presentation (so they can be one of your slides)
  - Think about how you might categorize or tag these later in Zotero.
- Bring all links or ways to locate to class in an informal list
- We will learn how to add these to **Zotero** (with tags & collections) in class  

### README.md (First Draft)
Create or update your README file inside your personal GitHub folder.

**Include the following:**
- **Working Title**
- **Short Project Description** (2–3 sentences)
- **Tools / Platforms / Technologies you're considering**
- **Early goals, collaborators, or questions**
- **Declared category or domain** (game, interactive art, VR, mobile, etc.)
- **Structure of your repository** (what files or folders are included and why)
- Link to or explain any visual references, sketches, or mockups you've made

### Updated GitHub Folder
- Make sure your personal folder contains **at least one updated document** reflecting your idea
  - This could be: brainstorming notes, speculative outlines, scoping draft, mood board notes, etc.
  - These can be text files, PDFs, images, or other document types
- If this builds on your previous submission, revise/improve before uploading

### GitHub Desktop Setup
- Install GitHub Desktop if you haven’t already:
  - [Install GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop)
- Clone the class repository to your local computer:
  - [Clone a repository to GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop)
- Use it to:
  - Edit your README.md or upload your documents
  - Commit and push changes from Desktop to your branch
  - Ensure you're working in **your own branch**
  - Begin becoming comfortable with version control

## What We’ll Do in Class 4
