# Week 3 – Student Activity Instructions

This guide outlines your activities for Week 3, building upon your brainstorming work from last week. You’ll begin by uploading your project materials to GitHub via the web interface, and then transition into using **GitHub Desktop** to manage your personal development branch.

You’ll also begin project scoping, research documentation, and setup of Zotero and GitHub tools to support ongoing development.

> 🧭 **Note on Semester Progress**: By **Week 7**, you will be presenting a clear proposal for peer and instructor feedback. The next few weeks are about turning your speculative ideas into structured project documentation. This week helps you start shaping that direction.

## 🟢 Part 1: Upload Week 2 Materials to GitHub (Web Interface)

### ✅ Step 1: Verify Your Branch and Folder
- Navigate to the class GitHub repository.
- Switch to your personal branch (e.g., `alex-smith-branch`).
- Confirm your folder exists at:
  ```
  projects/[your-name]/
  ```

### ✅ Step 2: Upload Your Files
- Upload the following files to your folder:
  - `brainstorm_variants.md`
  - `kill_my_idea.md` *(if completed)*
- Use the "Add file → Upload files" button.
- Commit with a clear message, e.g.:
  ```
  Added Week 2 brainstorm and kill-my-idea docs
  ```

### ✅ Step 3: Submit Pull Request to Main
1. Go to the **Pull Requests** tab.
2. Click **New Pull Request**.
3. Set:
   - **Base branch**: `main`
   - **Compare branch**: `[your-name]-branch`
4. Title your PR:
   ```
   [Your Name] – Initial Submission
   ```
5. Click **Create Pull Request**.

Your instructor will review and merge it.

## 🟠 Part 3: Sync Your Branch with Main Using GitHub Desktop

### ✅ Step 1: Pull the Latest Main
- In GitHub Desktop, switch to the `main` branch
- Click **Fetch origin**, then **Pull** to get latest changes

### ✅ Step 2: Switch to Your Branch
- Use the branch dropdown to switch to your personal branch

### ✅ Step 3: Merge Main Into Your Branch
- Go to `Branch → Update from main`
- Accept the merge and **commit** the changes
- Click **Push origin** to update your branch online

You now have an updated, synchronized development branch.

## 🔵 Part 4: Project Scoping (Aspirational → LVP → PoC)

> 💬 _Even if your idea is still forming, this activity will help you shape your curiosity into a possible direction._

Use your brainstorm variants to define three levels of scope:

1. **Create a new file:**
   ```
   project_scope.md
   ```
2. Use this structure:
```markdown
# Project Scope

## Aspirational Climax
Describe your most ambitious vision. If your project could be amazing, what would it become?

## Least Viable Prototype (LVP)
What’s a simplified but complete version you will build during the next semester?

## Proof of Concept (PoC)
What is the smallest working test or core idea that proves your project is worth pursuing and that you will aim for for this semester?

## Notes:
- If you're still unsure about your project, describe what you're curious about or want to explore.
- You can revise this file later — it's a living document.
```

3. Commit and push this file to your branch.

✅ Tip: This file helps prepare you for **Week 7 peer review**, where you will present your project for structured feedback.

## 🟣 Part 5: Create Your GitHub Project Board  

1. Go to the **Projects** tab in the repo.
2. Click on "+ New Project" green button
3. Select the project template "MTEC3501_Project_Template"
4. Create a new Template project titled:
   ```
   [Your Name] – [Project Name]
   ```
5. Add a link to this board in your `README.md`
✅ This board will become the foundation of your semester workflow.

---

## 🔶 Part 6: Convert Brainstorm Variants Into GitHub Issues  

For each brainstorm idea:
1. Create a new GitHub **Issue**
2. Title: Short name for the idea
3. Content: Copy from your `brainstorm_variants.md`
4. Tag it:
   - `🧠 Idea`
   - `🎯 Needs Research`
   - `🚧 Under Consideration`
5. Assign it to yourself and add it to your project board

✅ These issues will grow into tasks you explore, develop, or revise.

## 🔷 Part 7: Precedent Research & Zotero  

1. Join the **class Zotero group** (link provided in class)
2. Add at least 2–3 precedent sources
3. Tag each with relevant themes
4. Write 1–2 sentence notes or summaries
5. In GitHub, create:
   ```
   precedent_research.md
   ```
6. Structure:
```markdown
### [Source Title or Link]
- **Tags:** [keywords]
- **Summary:** What is it and why is it useful?
- **Relevance to your idea**
```
7. Commit to your branch

✅ Option: Use AI to help summarize or annotate sources — just note if AI was used.

## 🧠 Final Tips:
- This is a **transitional week** from speculation to structure.
- If you don’t know your final project, focus on what inspires you.
- Keep all files in your personal folder and commit changes regularly.
- Begin preparing for **Week 7** when your project will be shared, reviewed, and discussed in a peer + instructor feedback session.

Let’s move from raw ideas to a researchable, buildable direction. 🚀
