# Week 3 â€“ Student Activity Instructions

This guide outlines your activities for Week 3, building upon your brainstorming work from last week. Youâ€™ll begin by uploading your project materials to GitHub via the web interface, and then transition into using **GitHub Desktop** to manage your personal development branch.

Youâ€™ll also begin project scoping, research documentation, and setup of Zotero and GitHub tools to support ongoing development.

> ðŸ§­ **Note on Semester Progress**: By **Week 7**, you will be presenting a clear proposal for peer and instructor feedback. The next few weeks are about turning your speculative ideas into structured project documentation. This week helps you start shaping that direction.

## ðŸŸ¢ Part 1: Upload Week 2 Materials to GitHub (Web Interface)

### âœ… Step 1: Verify Your Branch and Folder

## ðŸŸ  Part 3: Sync Your Branch with Main Using GitHub Desktop

### âœ… Step 1: Pull the Latest Main
- In GitHub Desktop, switch to the `main` branch
- Click **Fetch origin**, then **Pull** to get latest changes

### âœ… Step 2: Switch to Your Branch
- Use the branch dropdown to switch to your personal branch

### âœ… Step 3: Merge Main Into Your Branch
- Go to `Branch â†’ Update from main`
- Accept the merge and **commit** the changes

## ðŸ”µ Part 4: Project Scoping (Aspirational â†’ LVP â†’ PoC)

> ðŸ’¬ _Even if your idea is still forming, this activity will help you shape your curiosity into a possible direction._

Use your brainstorm variants to define three levels of scope:

1. **Create a new file:**
   ```
   project_scope.md
   ```
2. Use this structure:
```markdown
# Project Scope

## Aspirational Climax
Describe your most ambitious vision. If your project could be amazing, what would it become?

## Least Viable Prototype (LVP)
Whatâ€™s a simplified but complete version you will build during the next semester?

## Proof of Concept (PoC)
What is the smallest working test or core idea that proves your project is worth pursuing and that you will aim for for this semester?

## Notes:
- If you're still unsure about your project, describe what you're curious about or want to explore.
- You can revise this file later â€” it's a living document.
```

3. Commit and push this file to your branch.

âœ… Tip: This file helps prepare you for **Week 7 peer review**, where you will present your project for structured feedback.

## ðŸŸ£ Part 5: Create Your GitHub Project Board

1. Go to the **Projects** tab in your repo.
2. Create a new **Board view** project titled:
   ```
   [Your Name] â€“ Project Board
   ```
3. Add columns:
   - `To Do`
   - `Needs Research`
   - `In Progress`
   - `Completed`
4. Add a link to this board in your `README.md`

âœ… This board will become the foundation of your semester workflow.

## ðŸ”¶ Part 6: Convert Brainstorm Variants Into GitHub Issues

For each brainstorm idea:
1. Create a new GitHub **Issue**
2. Title: Short name for the idea
3. Content: Copy from your `brainstorm_variants.md`
4. Tag it:
   - `ðŸ§  Idea`
   - `ðŸŽ¯ Needs Research`
   - `ðŸš§ Under Consideration`
5. Assign it to yourself and add it to your project board

âœ… These issues will grow into tasks you explore, develop, or revise.

## ðŸ”· Part 7: Precedent Research & Zotero

1. Join the **class Zotero group** (link provided in class)
2. Add at least 2â€“3 precedent sources
3. Tag each with relevant themes
4. Write 1â€“2 sentence notes or summaries
5. In GitHub, create:
   ```
   precedent_research.md
   ```
6. Structure:
```markdown
### [Source Title or Link]
- **Tags:** [keywords]
- **Summary:** What is it and why is it useful?
- **Relevance to your idea**
```
7. Commit to your branch

âœ… Option: Use AI to help summarize or annotate sources â€” just note if AI was used.

## ðŸ§  Final Tips:
- This is a **transitional week** from speculation to structure.
- If you donâ€™t know your final project, focus on what inspires you.
- Keep all files in your personal folder and commit changes regularly.
- Begin preparing for **Week 7** when your project will be shared, reviewed, and discussed in a peer + instructor feedback session.

Letâ€™s move from raw ideas to a researchable, buildable direction. ðŸš€
