# Assignment 02: Ongoing Brainstorming and Expansion

**Due:** [Instructor-defined deadline]  
**Objective:** To continue refining, diversifying, and strengthening your project idea using GitHub-based collaborative brainstorming techniques.

---

## **Assignment Overview**
Following the in-class brainstorming activities, you will now continue developing your idea independently and through peer interaction. This assignment will:
- Deepen your engagement with different types of brainstorming.
- Help you push your idea in multiple creative and technical directions.
- Give you practice using GitHub Issues, Discussions, PRs, and Wikis.

---

## **Part 1: Expand Your Own Brainstorming Issue**

✅ **Update your original GitHub Issue**:
- Revisit your "Brainstorming Starter Idea" Issue.
- Add **at least two new comments** to your own issue with new thoughts, changes, or spontaneous ideas.
- Reflect on any feedback you’ve already received.

✅ **Try one of the following for each new comment**:
- Take your idea into a new domain or discipline.  
  _Example: Turn a digital museum archive project into a high school history class toolkit._
- Consider a radically different delivery platform.  
  _Example: Convert your social app into a tangible board game or kiosk experience._
- Imagine it scaled down to its simplest form.  
  _Example: Could your immersive AR experience work as a simple webcomic?_ 
- Imagine it scaled up to an institutional or international context.  
  _Example: What would it look like if supported by UNESCO or Google?_ 
- Think about who the project is *not* for, and flip it.  
  _Example: If your app is designed for college students, what happens if it's rebuilt for elders or children?_

## **Part 2: Respond Using All Brainstorming Modes**

✅ **Respond to other students’ Brainstorming Issues using a variety of brainstorming formats**:
You are expected to comment on at least **four** different student Issues, using **each of the following techniques at least once**:

### **1. Yes, And...**
```markdown
✅ **Original Idea Summary:** A mobile app that matches commuters with podcasts based on travel time.
💡 **Yes, and...** You could integrate real-time traffic data so it adapts the podcast recommendation.
🔄 **Follow-up Question:** What happens if the app also suggests content based on current mood or weather?
```

### **2. Forced Juxtaposition**
Pick two seemingly unrelated words or concepts and link them to the student's project.
```markdown
🎲 **Random Concepts Introduced:** coral reefs + vending machines  
🔗 **Connection:** What if your educational game delivered random "idea cards" like a vending machine, themed around endangered ecosystems?
🧠 **New Angle:** The randomness could encourage players to mix and remix concepts from different biomes.
```

### **3. Devil’s Advocate / Kill Your Idea**
Challenge the idea constructively by pointing out flaws and asking how to improve it.
```markdown
⚠️ **Potential Weakness:** This museum tour app assumes constant WiFi, which isn’t always available.
🔁 **Proposed Solution:** Could the app include downloadable maps and cached content in offline mode?
🤔 **Challenge Question:** Would this work as a printed artifact or tactile installation for low-tech users?
```

### **4. Mind Map Anchor**
Suggest a central concept that could reframe or reorganize the idea visually.
```markdown
🧭 **Anchor Concept:** "Ritual"  
🕸️ **Branching Ideas:** Cultural rituals, daily routines, sacred spaces, tech rituals  
📌 **New Focus Area:** Frame the digital storytelling project around human rituals across eras and devices.
```

✅ Be thoughtful and expansive. Push your peers’ projects into new creative or technical territory.

## **Part 3: Propose 3 New Variants of Your Project Idea**

✅ Create a new markdown file in your GitHub project folder:
```
brainstorm_variants.md
```
In that file, list **three distinctly different versions** of your project idea:
- They can differ in **purpose**, **audience**, **media**, **scale**, or **method**.
- You can include sketches, bullet points, diagrams, or flowcharts.

_Example Variants:_
1. A solo digital narrative told through SMS-style interactions.  
2. A museum installation that lets visitors remix historic propaganda.  
3. A cooperative tabletop card game built around conflict negotiation strategies.

---

## **Part 4: AI Brainstorming Extension (Optional Bonus)**

✅ Use an AI tool (e.g., ChatGPT or Copilot) to brainstorm:
- Prompt the AI with a summary of your idea.
- Ask it to suggest:
  - Alternate forms of implementation
  - Comparable projects
  - Potential audiences or users

✅ Copy the most useful or surprising outputs into your `brainstorm_variants.md` file, labeled as **“AI Brainstorming”**.

---

## **Submission Checklist**
- [ ] You added 2+ new comments to your own brainstorming GitHub Issue.
- [ ] You posted responses on 4 other students’ Issues, using **each brainstorming technique** at least once.
- [ ] You created a `brainstorm_variants.md` file in your GitHub project folder with 3 clear idea variants.
- [ ] (Optional) You used AI to generate additional brainstorming insights.

---

## **Evaluation Criteria**
- ✅ **Creative Risk:** How far did you push your idea?
- ✅ **Breadth:** How diverse are the proposed variants?
- ✅ **Engagement:** Are your comments thoughtful and exploratory?
- ✅ **Documentation:** Is your GitHub content clear and complete?

Let your imagination explore extreme possibilities—then let GitHub help you document and iterate. 🚀
