# Project Scope
- I want to make a Twine Game that takes place in the future, where the human race has collapse due a plague or an apocalypse. The Player need to make choices that will ultimately decide how the game ends. 

## Aspirational Climax
Describe your most ambitious vision. If your project could be amazing, what would it become?
- Running Smoothly
- People enjoying the story
- this project may become something that will remembered 

## Least Viable Prototype (LVP)
Whatâ€™s a simplified but complete version you will build during the next semester?
- The most simplified version of the game would be cuts into different parts if I can't fully put an entire story together. 

## Proof of Concept (PoC)
What is the smallest working test or core idea that proves your project is worth pursuing and that you will aim for for this semester?
