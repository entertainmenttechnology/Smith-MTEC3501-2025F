# The Contagion Zone

A choice-driven, narrative-focused Twine project exploring survival, morality, and societal collapse through interactive storytelling.

## 📘 Project Overview
**The Contagion Zone** is an emotionally intense Twine game set in a quarantined region on the brink of collapse. Players navigate a world infected not only by disease, but by fear, secrecy, and the breakdown of social order. Every choice shapes the story, relationships, and ultimately the fate of the world.

This repository contains the Twine source files, documentation, and assets for the project.
