**Potiential Weakness**: What if I don't put the setting of the game in the future. The game can take place in the past. What if the users don't like the choices that are given to them and won't progress throughout the game.  
**Proposed Solution**: The game can take place in the future but try not to set the timeline way ahead. Making the choices very interested depending on what choice they want.   
**Challenge Question**: How can I make this game very interested to the viewers, maybe create a trailer of the game
