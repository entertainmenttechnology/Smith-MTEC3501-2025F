# Project Forest — Asset & Animation Library

**Project Forest** is a 2D Action-Adventure RPG currently in development. This repository is dedicated specifically to building a **comprehensive library of assets and animations** for use in the full game, which will be developed in **Unity**.

These assets also serve as a long-term portfolio project and can be reused for future games or shared with collaborators.

---

## 🎨 Repository Purpose

This repository exists to:

- Develop a **complete library of 2D game assets** (characters, enemies, tilesets, UI, effects)
- Create polished **pixel-art animations** (movement, attacks, magic, damage, etc.)
- Build reusable sprite sheets that work smoothly inside **Unity’s animation system**
- Practice and strengthen game asset production workflows
- Prepare all assets needed for the full *Project Forest* Unity game after college
- Produce animations and assets that friends or collaborators can use in their own projects

**Primary Tool:**\
🟦 **Aseprite** — for all pixel art and animation work

---

## 🎮 Game Context

Although this repository focuses on assets, the assets correspond to the larger vision of **Project Forest**, a 2D side-scrolling RPG where you explore towns, forests, and dungeons as an adventurer helping those in need.

The demo version introduces the game’s world, characters, and basic mechanics.

## 🧭 Planned Asset Categories

This repository will include:

### 1. Character Assets

- Player sprites (idle, run, attack, jump, hurt, etc.)
- NPC sprites

### 2. Enemy Assets

- Basic enemies
- Hit reactions, walk, idle, attack, jump animations

### 3. Weapons & Items

- Melee weapons&#x20;
- Ranged weapons
- Potions, consumables, loot items

### 6. Visual Effects

- Attack slashes
- Magic effects
- Impact particles
- Item pickups

All animations will be structured for Unity’s Animator system.

## 🧪 Demo Asset Goals

The demo will use:

- 3 melee weapon sets

- 2 ranged weapons

- 2 potion types

- Forest + town tilesets (maybe but this is a low chance depending on how I want the first area to be)

- Early NPC sprites



---

## 🚧 Challenges & Development Goals

### Current Challenges

- Consistent artstyle across many asset types

- Animation timing and readability

- Creating enough assets to support the full gameplay loop

### Goals for This Semester & Next

- Build a **usable asset library** ready for Unity
- Develop all demo assets
- Strengthen proficiency in Aseprite and Unity workflows
