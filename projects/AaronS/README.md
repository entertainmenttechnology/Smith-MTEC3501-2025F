# VIBEE 🎥🙂

**Vibee** is an AI-powered emotion detection app.  
The goal is to explore how computers can recognize human emotions in real time using a webcam.

This repository contains **Prototype 1**, which focuses on:
- Accessing a laptop webcam
- Detecting a human face
- Identifying basic emotions (happy, frowning, neutral)

---

## What Vibee Does (Prototype 1)

- Uses your **laptop webcam**
- Detects a **single face**
- Classifies emotion as:
  - 😊 Happy  
  - 😐 Neutral  
  - ☹️ Frowning  

This prototype is a **proof of concept**, not a finished product.

## Software

- **Python**
- **OpenCV** – webcam access & face detection
- **DeepFace** – emotion recognition using deep learning
- **NumPy**

---

## How It Works (Simple Explanation)

1. OpenCV turns on the webcam  
2. A face is detected in each frame  
3. The face is sent to DeepFace  
4. DeepFace predicts the emotion  
5. The emotion label is displayed on screen
