VIBEE 🎥🙂
Vibee is an AI-powered emotion detection app.
The goal is to explore how computers can recognize human emotions in real time using a webcam.

This repository contains Prototype 1, which focuses on:

Accessing a laptop webcam
Detecting a human face
Identifying basic emotions (happy, frowning, neutral)
What Vibee Does (Prototype 1)
Uses your laptop webcam
Detects a single face
Classifies emotion as:
😊 Happy
😐 Neutral
☹️ Frowning
This prototype is a proof of concept, not a finished product.

Software
Python
OpenCV – webcam access & face detection
DeepFace – emotion recognition using deep learning
NumPy
How It Works (Simple Explanation)
OpenCV turns on the webcam
A face is detected in each frame
The face is sent to DeepFace
DeepFace predicts the emotion
The emotion label is displayed on screen
