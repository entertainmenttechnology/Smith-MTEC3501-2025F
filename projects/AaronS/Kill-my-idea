  Weakness

My app depends on reading a person’s mood, but emotions can change fast or be hard to detect correctly.

 Proposed Solution

I use a mix of signals—like face, voice, and user input—to help the app understand moods more accurately.

 Challenge

Mood detection isn’t always right and can make the app choose music that feels off or doesn’t fit the moment.

Question

How do I keep mood detection accurate and fair so the app feels helpful, not random or annoying?
