## 🚀 **Overview**

**Sonic Evolution** is a speculative project where Sonic’s memories have been stolen by an unknown entity.  
To reclaim them, Sonic travels through iconic locations from his past adventures, regaining abilities along the way.

This project is both:
- A **love letter** to the Sonic franchise  
- A **learning tool** to develop skills in Unity, C#, level design, and asset development  

---

## 🌀 **Core Concept**

Revisit Sonic’s most iconic adventures across different eras.  
As Sonic retrieves fragments of his memory, he unlocks abilities that reflect his evolution throughout the series.

**Key Elements:**
- High-speed movement and Boost-style gameplay  
- Portals that transition between eras  
- Abilities that evolve alongside Sonic’s regained memories  

---

## 🎯 **Project Goals**

- Improve Unity development & game architecture skills  
- Build a polished high-speed character controller  
- Study & recreate Sonic mechanics authentically  
- Learn the fundamentals of asset development and level flow
