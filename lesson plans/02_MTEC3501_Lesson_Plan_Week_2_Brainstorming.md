## **1. GitHub Personal Project Management Setup**
âœ… **Skills Introduced:** Branching, folder structure, uploading content, using Pull Requests.

### **Activities:**
- Create a branch: `[your-name]-branch`
- Create folder: `/projects/[your-name]/`
- Upload `project_idea.md` (from last weekâ€™s speculative assignment)
- Open a Pull Request (PR) to merge into `main`

---

## **2. Zotero for Collaborative Research**
âœ… **Skills Introduced:** Reference management, source organization, academic citation.

### **Activities:**
- Join the class Zotero Group (invitation link provided)
- Install the Zotero Connector (Chrome/Firefox)
- Review the existing shared bibliography
- Add your first source with meaningful tags

---

## **3. Brainstorming Activities Using GitHub**
âœ… **Skills Introduced:** Multiple brainstorming techniques; GitHub tools: Issues, Discussions, Comments, PRs, Wiki

### **Techniques (Part 1):**
- **Rapid Ideation** â†’ GitHub Issues
- **"Yes, And..." Expansion** â†’ Comments on Issues

### **Techniques (Part 2):**
- **Forced Juxtaposition** â†’ GitHub Discussions
- **Kill Your Idea Test** â†’ Markdown file + Pull Request
- **Mind Map Synthesis** â†’ Miro mind map â†’ GitHub Wiki

---

## **4. Precedent Research & Framing**
âœ… **Goal:** Situate project ideas within a wider landscape of existing work.

### **Discussion Topics:**
- What makes a strong precedent?
- How do precedents inspire vs. constrain?
- How can citations establish authority and credibility?

### **Activities:**
- Search for 2â€“3 relevant sources using Zotero.
- Add them to the shared library with clear **tags**.
- Create a new page or file in your GitHub folder: `precedent_research.md`
  - List each precedent and explain:
    - Why itâ€™s relevant
    - What you learned from it
    - How your project differs or extends it

---

## **5. Vision & Project Scope Definition**
âœ… **Framing the Project:**
- **Proof of Concept (PoC):** Minimal version that shows feasibility
- **LVP / Functioning Prototype:** Leanest functional form
- **Aspirational Climax:** What would this look like with no limitations?

### **Activity:**
Students reflect on their current idea and identify:
- Whatâ€™s the PoC?
- What would qualify as a functioning prototype?
- What would be the dream implementation?

---

## **6. Final Reflection + Assignment**
âœ… **In-Class Discussion:**
- What surprised you in todayâ€™s brainstorming?
- What are your next action items?

âœ… **Homework:**
- Refine your `project_idea.md` based on brainstorming + precedent research
- Complete your `precedent_research.md` file with at least 2 sources
- Ensure all brainstorming components are complete in GitHub
- Add at least **one academic source** to Zotero with tags
- Begin thinking about tools, media, and platforms your project may need
