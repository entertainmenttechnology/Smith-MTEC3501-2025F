## 🕒 Class Agenda (150 Minutes)

### 🟢 Part 1 – GitHub Web Recap and Upload (20 min)
- ✅ Verify each student’s folder exists in their branch
- ✅ Students upload `brainstorm_variants.md` and `kill_my_idea.md`
- ✅ Create and submit Pull Request to merge into `main`
- 👨‍🏫 Instructor begins merging PRs during next segment

### 🔵 Part 2 – Project Idea Roundtable (40 min)
- 🗣️ Each student presents their current idea status (5 mins each)
- 🧭 Instructor + classmates ask clarifying or exploratory questions
- ✅ Encourage curiosity-driven exploration (not perfection)

### 🟡 Part 2 – GitHub Desktop Setup (20 min)

- ✅ Students clone the repo locally and log in
- ✅ Instructor walkthrough: Pull latest `main`, switch to personal branch, merge `main` into branch, push changes
- 🧠 Explanation: This is now the standard workflow

### 🟣 Part 3 – Mini-Lecture: What Is Project Scope? What Is Research? (25 min)

#### 🔷 What Is Project Scope?
- 🧠 Define: Aspirational Climax, Least Viable Prototype (LVP), Proof of Concept (PoC)
- 🧩 Examples from past projects
- 📈 Connect to Week 7 Milestone: What you’ll need ready

#### 🔶 Part 4. What Is Research? Four Types

> “Not every project needs all of these, but every project needs some. You’re not just inventing — you’re in conversation with a world of practice and knowledge.”

1. **Inspirational Research**
   - Personal influences (games, films, performances, books)
   - Mood-setting, style, tone, world-building
   - *Use:* Early ideation & Zotero entries this week

2. **Precedent Research**
   - Similar past work or case studies
   - How others have structured, executed, or designed projects
   - *Use:* Mid-stage framing, conceptual benchmarking

3. **Technical Research**
   - Tools, methods, platforms
   - Feasibility, functionality, integration
   - *Use:* Guides your toolchain and timeline

4. **Theoretical / Contextual Research**
   - Scholarly frameworks, cultural ideas, narrative theory, critical design
   - Adds purpose, significance, depth
   - *Use:* Stronger proposals, reflective documentation

✅ Optional 5th: **User Research**
- Target audience, testing feedback, use cases
- Typically enters later, but worth mentioning early

  - Begin **Inspirational Precedent Research**:
    - Browse Zotero class library
    - Add 2–3 entries to `precedent_research.md`
    - Include games, performances, art, tech — anything influential or inspirational
    - Use this format:
```markdown
### [Source Title or Link]
- **Type:** (Game, Film, Article, Performance, etc.)
- **Why it inspires me:** (Short reflection)
- **Tags:** [keywords]
```
- 👨‍🏫 Instructor remains available for 1:1 troubleshooting in Zoom or breakout rooms

- ✅ Recap:
  - You now have a scoped idea, a board, and a research start
  - Your project board is a living tool — update it regularly
- 🗓️ Preview:
  - Week 4: Deep dive into research types, Zotero usage, and citation formatting
  - Building toward Week 7: proposal milestone

---

## 🧩 Materials Needed
- Shared GitHub class repository
- GitHub Desktop installed
- Class Zotero group link (in chat or pinned post)
- Examples of PoC/LVP/Aspirational formats (optional slide deck or PDF)

---

## 📌 Instructor Reminders
- Merge all PRs before GitHub Desktop sync walkthrough
- Observe idea-sharing to gauge project maturity levels
- Encourage students still “in the fog” — scoping is also discovery
- Reframe Zotero uploads as inspirational sources, not academic citations
