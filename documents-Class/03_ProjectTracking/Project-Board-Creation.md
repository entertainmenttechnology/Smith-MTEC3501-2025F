# MTEC 3501 – Project Board Setup & Tracking (GitHub Kanban)

This guide walks students through creating a GitHub Project Board in their individual repository to manage their Culmination Project using a Kanban-style workflow. This revised method focuses on using **workflow-based columns** (e.g., Assigned, In Progress, Done) while using **labels** to track the type of task (e.g., Research, Design, Production).

---

## 🔧 Step 1: Create a New GitHub Project (Kanban Style)

1. Navigate to **your individual GitHub repository**.
2. Click on the **Projects** tab.
3. Select **“New Project”**.
4. Choose the **Board (Kanban)** layout.
5. Name your board:  
   `Project Board – [Your Name]` (e.g., `Project Board – Ima Student`)
6. Optional: Add a short description. Example:  
   `Kanban board for tracking progress on my Culmination Project`
7. Click **Create**.

---

## 📁 Step 2: Add Workflow Columns

Set up the following **columns** to reflect task progress:

- `📥 Assigned` — Tasks assigned but not yet started
- `🚧 In Progress` — Work currently being done
- `⏸ Deferred` — Blocked or paused items
- `✅ Done` — Completed tasks

To create a column:
- Click **“+ Add column”**
- Name it exactly as above
- Drag and reorder as needed

---

## 📝 Step 3: Add Cards (Issues) to Your Board

You can add cards directly or convert existing **Issues**:

1. Click **“+ Add item”** under any column.
2. Either:
   - **Create a note** (good for initial tasks or ideas), or
   - **Convert an existing issue** using "Add to project" from the issue page.
3. Add 3–5 initial tasks to each relevant column. These can be refined later.

---

## 🏷 Step 4: Use Labels to Classify Task Types

Apply **labels** to clarify what kind of task each item is. This replaces SRDMPA-aligned columns with label tracking.

Suggested labels:

- `🧠 Research` — Precedent, inspiration, technical background
- `🎨 Design` — Visual mockups, sketches, UI diagrams
- `🛠 Produce` — Development, builds, fabrication
- `📢 Publish` — Documentation, presentation, outreach
- `📊 Assess` — Testing, peer feedback, revision
- `🤖 AI Used` — Where AI helped generate output

Other useful labels:
- `🔥 High Priority`
- `💡 Idea`
- `⚠️ Needs Help`

You can create these under **Issues > Labels** if not already available.

---

## 📅 Step 5: Add Milestones (Timeline Tracking)

1. Go to **Issues > Milestones**.
2. Click **“New milestone”**.
3. Create at least 3 milestones:
   - `Proposal Approved`
   - `Prototype Ready`
   - `Final Presentation`
4. Set due dates that align with class schedule.
5. Link Issues or Pull Requests to these milestones.

## ✅ Final Checklist

**Project Board Setup**
- [ ] Created a **Project Board** with correct title and description
- [ ] Added the following columns:
  - `📥 Assigned`
  - `🚧 In Progress`
  - `⏸ Deferred`
  - `✅ Done`
- [ ] Populated board with **3–5 initial cards**
- [ ] Converted existing Issues (if applicable) into cards

**Labels and Classification**

## 💡 Tips

- Drag and drop cards between columns as your work progresses.
- Use **comments** inside issues or cards to document progress.
- Labels can be layered — a single card can be both `🧠 Research` and `🤖 AI Used`.
- You can reuse this process in any course or project.


Let your instructor know once your board is ready for review.
