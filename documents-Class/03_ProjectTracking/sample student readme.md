# Sample Student README – MTEC 3501

This is an example README document created for MTEC 3501 Culmination Project Development. It is written from the perspective of a fictional student, **Ima Student**, and is intended to demonstrate the kind of content and structure you might include in your own README file.

The README helps explain your project direction, tools, collaborators, and repository layout. This is just one way to approach your README—your version may look different depending on your project type (game, installation, app, etc.).

**Tip:** Look at public repositories on GitHub for additional examples of how other developers and artists structure their READMEs. You can search GitHub for repositories related to your project domain and review how they describe their goals and structure. Here are a few useful resources:

- [GitHub Docs: About READMEs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes)

## Student: Ima Student  
### Project Title: Shadow Circuit

## Description
Shadow Circuit is an interactive installation that uses real-time motion tracking and projected light to generate poetic shadow responses. It’s part narrative, part kinetic sculpture, and explores themes of memory, presence, and decay.

_This section should give a concise yet engaging overview of your project—what it is, what it does, and why it matters. Aim to communicate tone and intent, even if the final execution is not yet defined._

## Project Category
Interactive Installation / Physical Computing / Narrative Art

_List the general category your project falls under. This helps you and others quickly identify what kind of project you're building—such as game, app, installation, VR experience, etc._

## Tools & Technologies
- Arduino + Sensors
- TouchDesigner
- GitHub for versioning
- Projection Mapping
- OSC Protocol
- AI-Assisted Prompt Generation

_List the tools, platforms, and programming languages or technologies you anticipate using. These may evolve over time, but this section gives a snapshot of your current plan._

_This is a visual outline of the directory structure within your GitHub folder. It shows how your project files are organized. Keeping a clear folder structure is essential for collaboration and future reference._

## Collaborators
None yet. May involve help from projection artist or creative writer.

_Use this space to acknowledge any collaborators (past, present, or planned), and their roles. It can also be used to note skills you're looking for._

## Research Questions
- How can reactive shadows convey emotional tone?
- What spatial arrangements make projected shadows feel more “alive”?
- Can AI generate ambient poetic responses in real time?

_List key questions that are currently guiding your research or experimentation. These can relate to conceptual, technical, design, or experiential concerns._

## Inspirational Materials
- Rafael Lozano-Hemmer's *Pulse Room*
- Shadow puppetry in *Wayang Kulit*
- Sensor-based design in *Sniff* (Golan Levin)

_This section includes your creative, aesthetic, or technical inspirations. These materials help communicate tone, artistic lineage, or relevant precedents that inform your idea._
