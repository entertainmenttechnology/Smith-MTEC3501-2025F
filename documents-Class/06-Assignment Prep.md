# MTEC 3501 – Assignment 6  
**Due Week 7 — Draft Presentation Cards + Project Materials**
CLASS ON ZOOM

---

## 🎯 Objective

This assignment is part of your **early presentation preparation** and **proposal documentation**. You will complete **two presentation cards** in the class-wide slide deck and update your GitHub repository with any new files or revisions. This is a low-pressure draft — the goal is **clarity, direction, and honesty** about your progress so far.

### 🧾 **Card 1 – Project Overview**

> **Instructions:**  
This card (#1) should describe your **project proposal**. Use clear text, helpful visuals, and make it **look good**.

**Must Include:**
- Your **name**
- The **name of your project** (real or placeholder is fine)
- A clear **description of the project** — What is it? Who is it for? What will it do?
- Optional: Add any **inspiration**, **moodboard**, or **early visuals**
- This card is the **foundation for your final poster**, so think BIG (imagine it's 41"x36")

> 📝 *This is where you sell the idea — make us care!*

### ✅ **Card 2 – Deliverables & Status**

> **Instructions:**  
This card documents your **deliverables** and where you are in the process.

**Steps:**
1. Visit the official [Presentation Deliverables Document](https://github.com/entertainmenttechnology/Smith-MTEC3501-2025F/blob/main/documents-Class/Presentation/02-Presentation_Deliverables.md).
2. **Copy the full list of deliverables** from that document into your Card 2.
3. For each deliverable, add a **brief status report**:
   - Are you just starting?
   - Is it partially done?
   - Are you stuck?
   - Have you even thought about it yet?

> 🎯 **Be honest.** You will not be penalized for being behind — but clarity helps us help you.

## 📁 2. Update Your GitHub Repository

Before next class, make sure your **GitHub folder** reflects your most current project materials:

- [ ] Update your **README** if necessary
- [ ] Upload any new notes, diagrams, or planning materials
- [ ] Begin organizing materials into logical folders
- [ ] Commit and push via GitHub Desktop

## 🗣️ 3. Prepare for Zoom Test Presentations (Week 7)

We will be doing **short Zoom test presentations** in the next class to try out your slides and give you feedback before your first formal review. Please be ready to **present your two cards** and describe your idea.

> You may revise the cards again before the formal presentation milestone — this is just a first pass.

## 🧠 Need Help?

- Ask a classmate to review your card layout or wording
- Use AI (e.g., ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot) to help convert ideas into Markdown or summaries
- Reach out to the professor with a GitHub Issue if you’re unsure where to put something
